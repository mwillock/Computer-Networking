# Computer-Networking Course Project
For this project, we were required to interview some friends. During the duration of this experiment, I will utilize Wireshark and its multiple functionalities as well as Excel. I will be using Wireshark to measure different packets that are traveling across the network, checking the performance of the network looking for delays between packets, duplicate Acks, examining all protocols and packets to see if they interfere with network’s performance.
DSU’s network is widely spread among the university, located on campus but also accessible off campus at two different locations such as the University Court Yards and Living Learning Commons. Student’s with off campus housing feel as if their network needs/requirements that their paying for aren’t’ being met.
