# Computer-Networking Course Project

DSU’s network is widely spread among the university, located on campus but also accessible off campus at two different locations such as the University Court Yards and Living Learning Commons. Student’s with off campus housing feel as if their network needs/requirements that their paying for aren’t’ being met.
